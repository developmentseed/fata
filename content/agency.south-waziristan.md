The security situation in South Waziristan took a drastic turn when U.S. and NATO forces invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and the subsequent refusal by the Taliban government to hand over the al-Qaeda leader behind the attacks, Osama bin Laden. Thousands from the Afghan Taliban, the Arab al-Qaeda, and their foreign affiliates&mdash;such as groups of Uzbeks, Chechens, and Tajiks&mdash;came to South Waziristan looking for refuge and bases to continue their fight against the American and NATO forces occupying Afghanistan.
