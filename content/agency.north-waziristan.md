North Waziristan, the second-largest of Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, is the most important springboard for violence in Afghanistan today. The most important militant group in the agency today is the Haqqani Network; the legendary Afghan mujahideen commander and current insurgent leader Jalaluddin Haqqani left his native Khost province and settled in North Waziristan's capital, Miram Shah, in the mid-1970s. Like his father, son Sirajuddin (who now manages the network) uses North Waziristan to recruit, as a safe haven, and for strategic depth. North Waziristan is well-suited as a base of operations because of its geographic isolation, difficult terrain and relatively stable coalition of tribal militants. Aside from the Haqqanis, the largest militant coalition in North Waziristan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur. 
 
North Waziristan has been a safe haven for successive waves of militants fleeing U.S. or Pakistani military operations, including thousands of Taliban and foreign fighters affiliated with al Qaeda and other groups. The Pakistani military has not conducted major military operations against militants in North Waziristan despite increasing public and private pressure from the U.S. government to do so, though it clashed with fighters before signing peace agreements in 2006 and 2008. North Waziristan has been the primary location of U.S. drone strikes in the FATA; from 2004 through mid-2010, the majority of drone strikes in the tribal agencies targeted North Waziristan.  _--[Anand Gopal, Mansur Khan Mahsud, and Brian Fishman](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_battle_for_pakistan_north_waziristan)_
