# Methodology
This survey was jointly conducted by the New America Foundation (NAF) and Terror Free Tomorrow (TFT), with field work in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan (FATA) by the Community Appraisal & Motivation Programme (CAMP), a Pakistani NGO operating in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Interviews were conducted face-to-face with 1,000 FATA residents age 18 or older across 120 villages/sampling points in all seven tribal Agencies of FATA-Pakistan. The fieldwork was conducted from June 30 to July 20, 2010. NAF-TFT-CAMP also conducted 200 separate interviews with local maliks and tribal elders. This study is held for future release. The conclusions in this report are based solely on the 1,000- resident sample.
The questionnaire consisted of 43 substantive questions, 19 demographic questions, and 24 quality control questions. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage random stratified sampling methodology. During the course of fieldwork, there were 1,294 contacts attempts made. There were 294 refusals giving the study a net response rate of 77.3 percent. The poll has a +/- 3 percent margin of error at the 95 percent confidence interval.

TFT, NAF and CAMP used face-to-face research techniques in FATA. Interviews were conducted by 22 trained interviewers (male and female) and 6 field supervisors, all of whom are Pakistanis and residents of FATA.
Before sending the interviewers and supervisors to the field, extensive project orientation and training workshops were conducted in Peshawar. During the training, interviewers and supervisors were briefed on a number of topics including, but not limited to, the objective of the survey and its details, selection of respondents, the questionnaire (both asking of questions and recording of responses), timing and control issues, and usage of the questionnaire. Mock interviews and field testing were also conducted.
Eleven survey teams were deployed, under the supervision of six supervisors. Each team was made responsible for interviewing respondents in their respective areas. Detailed field work-plan and list of villages were shared with the field teams before field deployment.

Interviews were subjected to numerous quality control procedures including 54.1 percent direct supervision of interviews, 27.8 percent back-check in person by the supervisor, and back-check by telephonic call by supervisor or the central office.

The survey was conducted in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The target sample was a random selection of Pakistani nationals having FATA residence, both male and female, above the age of 18. The sample covered all seven tribal agencies, namely Khyber, Mohmand, Bajaur, Kurram. Orakzai, North Waziristan and South Waziristan, with the number of sampling points chosen in proportion to the size of each Agency’s population. Following is the sample plan of the survey.

## Proportion Stratified Sample Size 

Agency | Population | Sample | Leaders Sample | Total  
-- | --
Bajaur | 595,227 | 202 | 40 | 242 
Mohmand | 334,453 | 114 | 23 | 137 
Khyber | 546,730 | 186 | 37 | 223 
Orkzia | 225,441 | 77 | 15 | 92 
Kurram | 448,310 | 152 | 31 | 183 
North Waziristan | 361,246 | 123 | 25 | 148   
South Waziristan | 429,841 | 146 | 29 | 175
**Total** | 2,941,248 | 1,000 | 200 | 1,200 

The National Census data from 1998 are used as the universe for this sample. The national census classifies villages as the primary unit in the rural areas. We used a multi-stage random stratified sampling method, selected over 120 primary sampling units, comprising villages in all the seven Agencies of FATA. The completed primary sample contains 120 sampling points; in which approximately 8 interviews were carried out in households selected in each village using a random walk. A total of 1,000 men and women from a scientific cross-section of FATA in terms of gender, age and other socio-economic characteristics are represented in the sample. For South and North Waziristan, however, local conditions only permitted CAMP personnel to sample men.

After selecting the villages, each village was divided into four hypothetical quarters. A starting point was selected in each quarter. Two starting points were selected for male respondents and two for female respondents. Three interviews were conducted around each starting point. Skipping of three households in Stratum I villages and skipping of three households in Stratum II villages were made after each successful interview. Male and female surveyors were used for male and females respondents respectively. For the selection of a household around a particular starting point the Right Hand Rule (RHR) was used for female interviewees and the Left Hand Rule (LHR) was used for male respondents.

# Background on Terror Free Tomorrow and the New America Foundation

Our previous jointly conducted public opinion surveys of Pakistan and Iran were featured on many international media outlets and throughout the blogosphere.

[Terror Free Tomorrow](http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/) is a non-partisan, 501(c) (3) not-for- profit established in Washington, D.C. designed to find out why people support or oppose extremism. TFT was the first to conduct uncensored, independent, comprehensive nationwide public opinion surveys in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria, path breaking surveys in Pakistan, and the first surveys of Indonesia following the tsunami in December 2004 and Pakistan after the October 2005 earthquake. Since 2005, Terror Free Tomorrow has conducted more than thirty nationwide public opinion surveys around the world, including in Iran, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Syria, Turkey, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, India, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere. TFT’s work has been covered by major media outlets around the world.

[The New America Foundation](http://newamerica.net/) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institute that invests in new thinkers and new ideas to address the next generation of challenges facing the United States. Launched in 1999, the foundation was guided through a period of rapid growth by founding president Ted Halstead. The institute is now led by President Steve Coll and a Board of Directors chaired by Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO of Google. New America is headquartered in Washington D.C. and also has a significant presence in California, the nation's largest laboratory of democracy. The New America Foundation’s Counterterrorism Strategy Initiative, which is co-directed by New America senior fellow Peter Bergen and Steve Coll and advised by Patrick Doherty, aims to provide data-based analysis of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and international terrorism.
