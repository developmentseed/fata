# About the Maps

The maps on this site combine data from a number of sources. The datasource used for national and sub-national administrative boundaries and labels in Pakistan and Jammu & Kashmir is GAUL - the Global Administrative Units Layers. This is the primary datasource used and recommended by NGOs working in Pakistan. Other international boundaries come from Natural Earth, and water bodies are from [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/). The drone strike overlay displays information compiled by [Year of the Drone](http://www.newamerica.net/drones).

The base map tiles are hosted by [Mapbox.com](http://mapbox.com/) and were created using open-source tools like [Mapnik](http://mapnik.org).
