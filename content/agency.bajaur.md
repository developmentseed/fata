Bajaur is the smallest of the seven administrative units of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of northwest Pakistan, a relatively inaccessible agency known for its hilly terrain. It borders Afghanistan’s Kunar province and Pakistan’s Dir district, a gateway to the Swat Valley in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), making it of strategic importance to Pakistan and the region.[1] The current population of Bajaur is more than 1 million, and the agency’s administrative headquarters is the town of Khar. As a hub of Taliban and al-Qaeda activities, the Afghan province of Kunar has greatly influenced the conservative and traditional Pashtun tribesmen of Bajaur.
