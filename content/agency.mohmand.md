Mohmand Agency suffers the same economic and governance problems as other regions in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Only 27 percent of Mohmand residents have access to clean drinking water,primary school enrollment in the district is 21.8 percent, and the net secondary school enrollment for males is an alarming 3.5 percent, while for females it is zero. Further, FATA parliamentarians do not believe that Pakistan has a plan for turning things around in Mohmand or in the FATA as a whole. In 2010, Pakistan allocated only 11 billion rupees ($140 million) for development in the FATA, which has an estimated population of 4 million people. This lack of assistance is a critical issue because Mohmand residents generally believe that the federal government is the only force that is capable of alleviating their poverty.
