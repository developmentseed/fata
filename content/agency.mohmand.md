Mohmand is considered to be the agency most culturally and politically integrated with the rest of Pakistan, despite endemic poverty, lack of government attention and extremely low levels of education in the agency. While always known for its religious conservatism, Mohmand in recent decades has seen ultraconservative Salafist ideology grow more widespread. Indigenous Taliban emerged as a major social force in the agency in 2006, when armed militants began patrolling the area and ordering residents to follow strict social codes. In June of that year, the militants became both more assertive and organized, bombing a tribal jirga (council of elders) in Mohmand. The July 2007 Lal Masjid (Red Mosque) incident in Islamabad also spurred increased violence in Mohmand, spurring local militants to take concrete action against the Pakistani government. Local Taliban gained notoriety for stoning to death a couple accused of adultery in 2007.  _--[Raza Khan](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_battle_for_pakistan_mohmand)_
