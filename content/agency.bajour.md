Bajaur is the smallest of the seven administrative units of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of northwest Pakistan, a relatively inaccessible agency known for its hilly terrain. It borders Afghanistan’s Kunar province and Pakistan’s Dir district, a gateway to the Swat Valley in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), making it of strategic importance to Pakistan and the region.[1] The current population of Bajaur is more than 1 million, and the agency’s administrative headquarters is the town of Khar.

As a hub of Taliban and al-Qaeda activities, the Afghan province of Kunar has greatly influenced the conservative and traditional Pashtun tribesmen of Bajaur. After the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001, fleeing militants crossed the border into Bajaur and exploited the tribal code of Pashtunwali, which requires hospitality and the giving of shelter. Bajauris treated the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters as guests.<[i] Bajaur still functions as a logistical base for the Taliban on both sides of the Durand Line, which divides Afghanistan and Pakistan. The agency’s significance in terrorists’ operational planning is illustrated by the fact that plots targeting London and Barcelona were linked to al-Qaeda operatives based in Bajaur.[ii] Additionally, a senior member of al-Qaeda, Abu Faraj al-Libbi, who was allegedly involved in attempts to assassinate Gen. Pervez Musharraf, then Pakistan’s president, told interrogators after his arrest in 2005 that he had lived in Bajaur for some time.[iii]
