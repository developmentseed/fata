Unlike other parts of the FATA, sectarian tensions rather than tribal or political issues are the main drivers of militancy in Kurram, the only agency where locals turned foreign fighters and al Qaeda away in 2001. Sunni-Shia feuding has since the 1980's been fueled and amplified by advanced weapons that passed through the agency during the Afghan jihad and were procured by locals, meaning the clashes between sectarian groups in Kurram look less like two rivals squabbling than a full-scale war. However, Taliban from the Mehsud and Wazir tribes of North and South Waziristan began trickling into the agency beginning in 2006, and since 2007 have been involved in anti-Shia fighting. _--[Mansur Khan Mahsud](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_battle_for_pakistan_kurram)_
