The only one of Pakistan's Federally-Administered Tribal Agencies to not directly border Afghanistan, Orakzai has nonetheless since 2004 been used as a sanctuary for Taliban fighters fleeing Pakistani military action in neighboring Waziristan. Between 2008 and 2009 in particular, Orakzai was a base for Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan leader Hakimullah Mehsud, who launched hundreds of attacks on NATO supply vehicles from the agency. As a result of attacks against Pakistani security agencies and NATO forces originating in Orakzai, it has seen a series of incursions from the Pakistani army seeking to root out militants based there. The agency is not only home to Taliban fighters, however. There are three distinct but often mutually reinforcing components to militancy in Orakzai: sectarian conflict between the 10 percent of the agency that is Shia Muslim and the majority Sunni population; a religiously inspired, locally motivated movement similar to the Tehrik-i-Nifaz Shariat-Muhammadi (TNSM) in the Swat Valley; and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan-inspired insurgency  _--[Raheel Khan](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_battle_for_pakistan_orakzai)_
