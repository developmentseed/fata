Khyber Agency is home to the historic and strategically important Khyber Pass into Afghanistan, and sits just across the Durand line from the Tora Bora cave complex, the mountainous hideout from which Osama bin Laden escaped in late 2001. Khyber is the most literate of Pakistan's tribal agencies, but it is also home to areas like the remote Tirah Valley, believed to have sheltered al Qaeda militants escaping into Pakistan in the wake of U.S. and NATO attacks on Afghanistan in 2001. Modern militancy in Khyber Agency is multifaceted: sectarian violence, Sunni groups aiming to establish a Taliban-style government, and drug mafias all fuel conflict in the area.  _--[Raheel Khan](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_battle_for_pakistan_khyber)_

_Note: The single drone strike in Kyber shown on the map above was reported only by the AP.  Two corroborating sources are required, so this incident is not counted in any of the larger tallies._
