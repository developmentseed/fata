Of all the tribal agencies and districts of the FATA, few have assumed as much importance for the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, as South Waziristan, the country's southernmost tribal agency and the largest by area. The people of South Waziristan are almost all orthodox Sunni Muslims, and a great majority of them are illiterate. 
 
After U.S. and NATO forces invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, thousands from the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and their foreign affiliates -- including groups of Uzbeks, Chechens and Tajiks -- came to South Waziristan looking for refuge and bases to continue their fight against the U.S. and NATO forces occupying Afghanistan. The local tribes, sympathetic to the cause, provided shelter and assistance to the fighters, while local militants who were affiliated with the Afghan Taliban government before Sept. 11 began to organize local Taliban groups across South Waziristan. In December 2007 local tribal and militant leaders formed the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella organization of dozens of Taliban groups throughout Pakistan, under the initial leadership of Baitullah Mehsud. 
 
The Taliban had at one point virtually taken over South Waziristan, running their own courts in the agency and collecting taxes from the local population. While recent military advances have mostly cleared the Taliban's structure and fighters, combat between militants and the Pakistani army in South Waziristan continues. _--[Mansur Khan Mahsud](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_battle_for_pakistan_south_waziristan)_
