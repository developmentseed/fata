Bajaur is the smallest of Pakistan's tribal agencies, a relatively inaccessible area known for its hilly terrain. It borders Afghanistan's Kunar province and Pakistan's Dir district, and is a gateway to the Swat Valley in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), making it of strategic importance to Pakistan and the region. Kunar, a hub of Taliban and al-Qaeda activities, has greatly influenced the conservative and traditional Pashtun tribesmen of Bajaur. After the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001, fleeing militants crossed the border into Bajaur and exploited the tribal code of Pashtunwali, which requires hospitality and the giving of shelter. Bajaur still functions as a logistical base for the Taliban on both sides of the Durand Line, which divides Afghanistan and Pakistan. The agency continues to be significant in terrorists' operational planning, and plots targeting London and Barcelona have been linked to al Qaeda operatives based in Bajaur. _--[Rahmanullah](http://newamerica.net/publications/policy/the_battle_for_pakistan_bajaur)_
